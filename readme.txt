OTTO Coding Challenge (GITHUB UPLOADED BUT THIS IS A BRANCH)
The solution for the coding challenge was implemented in Python with Dynamic Programming to determine OTTO's
best(lowest) possible time.

For reference, the processing time for each sample input:
sample_input_small  -> 0.003 seconds
sample_input_medium -> 0.737 seconds
sample_input_large  -> 1212.138 seconds

Getting Started
Dependencies
Python 3.7

Executing program
The 'solution_executable.py' script was tested with the following command:

cat sample_input_small.txt | python3 solution_executable.py | tee output_small.txt
